        <p className="text-lg text-center">Hello! I'm Susheel Sahu, an enthusiastic developer driven by a passion for creating compelling applications and tackling intricate challenges. Currently enrolled in the B.Sc. Mathematical Science program with a major in Computer Science at P.G.D.A.V College, University of Delhi, I am committed to refining my skills and making meaningful contributions to cutting-edge projects.

Throughout my academic journey, I've cultivated proficiency in languages such as C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, along with expertise in tools and frameworks including React.js, Pandas, MySQL, and Git. These skills empower me to architect robust solutions and deliver exceptional user experiences.

Outside the classroom, I've actively participated in extracurricular activities, notably as a former Core Member and App Developer at Google Developer Student Club. I've also demonstrated my technical prowess by securing top positions in competitive coding events, including a notable 2nd place in the Blind Coding Competition at DUCS, Sankalan â€™24, and a 3rd place in the Code Auction.

I thrive in dynamic environments where creativity and innovation flourish, and I'm eager to leverage my skills to contribute to transformative projects. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on creating the next breakthrough in technology!</p>
